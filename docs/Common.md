(work in progress...)
The `TRICE` macros look like printf() but work under the hood completely different.
and small loggging technique, a tracer in software usable
  - for debugging dynamic behaviour during development, 
  - as runtime logger or simply for narrow bandwidth logging in the field even with encryption.

- The `til.json` file can be deleted and regenerated from the sources anytime. In that case you get rid of all legacy strings but it is better to keep them for compability reasons.
- You can disable the TRICE code generation on file or project level, so no need to remove the TRICE macros from the code after dynamic debugging.

### RealTimeTransfer
- see [./docs/SeggerRTT.md](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/SeggerRTT.md)
### Examples
- see [test](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/test)


### Hint if you have only one spare pin and no UART
- One free GPIO-Pin is already enough for using TRICE. You can transmit each basic trice (4 bytes) as bare messages over one pin:
  - ![manchester1.PNG](./README.media/manchester1.PNG)
  - ![manchester2.PNG](./README.media/manchester2.PNG)
  - See [https://circuitcellar.com/cc-blog/a-trace-tool-for-embedded-systems/](https://circuitcellar.com/cc-blog/a-trace-tool-for-embedded-systems/) for more information. As trace dongle you can use any spare microcontroller board with an UART together with an FTDI USB converter.
  - This slow path is usable because trice needs only few bytes for transmission.


- Not much to do:
  - Copy config file [_triceConfig.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/_triceConfig.h) as `triceConfig.h` to your project or take it from one of the [test projects](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/test/) 
  - Add a few [small C-files](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/) to your project and include [trice.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/trice.h) where trices are used.

- If you run tests apply the `-p=1` flag to avoid parallel execution: `go test ./... -p=1` This is slower but avoids trouble with the displayserver tests.


- Add [triceBareFifo.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/triceBareFifo.c) or [triceEscFifo.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/triceEscFifo.c)  and acompanying files as they are to your project
- #include [trice.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/trice.h) as is in your source file to use trice
- Copy [_triceConfig.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/_triceConfig.h), rename to `triceConfig.h` and adapt to your needs.
- [triceCheck.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/triceCheck.c) 
is example code and for testing
- Run `trice u` in root of your C|Cpp source project after code instrumentation with `TRICE*` statements to generate a project specific or common [til.json](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/til.json) file.
- Compile, flash & run `trice log -port COMm -baud n` with correct values m and n.




The `triceServe` takes the 4 bytes trice values from the triceFifo, adds control information and puts that into the triceWriteBuffer, with at least 8 bytes size.
  - At this stage the trice out format is done (all optionally encrypted):
    - bare with sync packages
    - wrapped bare
    - escaped transmit format
    - your decision ...
  - The triceFifo can be also a direct writeBuffer for TRICEmacro generated output format. This is useful with escaped transmit format to incorporate dynamic strings in an efficient way. Check code of test example [MDK-ARM_LL_UART_RTT0_ESC_STM32F030R8_NUCLEO-64](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/test/MDK-ARM_LL_UART_RTT0_ESC_STM32F030R8_NUCLEO-64) for example.
- The bytes go from triceWriteBuffer to the PC and there the `trice` tool receives them.
- With the help of the [til.json](https://github.com/rokath/trice/blob/master/til.json) file the trices get then visualized on the PC.
- It is also possible to let the debug probe transfer the buffer to the PC (see *SeggerRTT* explanation for details). This keeps the implementation clearer and allows to see the trice strings directly during debugging.

## Quick setup (See also test examples)

- Add [triceBareFifo.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/triceBareFifo.c) or [triceEscFifo.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/triceEscFifo.c)  and acompanying files as they are to your project
- #include [trice.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/trice.h) as is in your source file to use trice
- Copy [_triceConfig.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/_triceConfig.h), rename to `triceConfig.h` and adapt to your needs.
- [triceCheck.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/triceCheck.c) 
is example code and for testing
- Run `trice u` in root of your C|Cpp source project after code instrumentation with `TRICE*` statements to generate a project specific or common [til.json](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/til.json) file.
- Compile, flash & run `trice log -port COMm -baud n` with correct values m and n.

## `TRICE0` |`TRICE8` |`TRICE16` |`TRICE32` |`TRICE64` macro
It is avoiding all the internal overhead (space and time) of a `printf()` 
statement but is easy to use. For example instead of writing 

```
printf("time is %d:%d:%d\n", hour, min, sec);
```
you can write
```
TRICE8("time is %d:%d:%d\n", hour, min, sec);
```
into a source file of your project. The `8` stands here for 8 bit values (`0`, `16`, `32` and `64` also possibe). Only values of the same size are allowed in one TRICE* statement, but you can use `TRICE32` consequently to match most cases for the prize of little overhead.

When performing `trice update` the source (tree) is parsed and in result this line changes to
```
TRICE8_3( Id(12345), "time is %d:%d:%d\n", hour, min, sec);
```
where ```12345``` is an as ID generated 16 bit random number not used so far. About 65000 different trice messages are possible. If not enough, the IDs are extendable to 32 bit. Automatically
the ID is added to an [ID list](https://github.com/rokath/trice/blob/master/til.json) together with the appropriate format string information. The TRICE`8_3` means 3 bytes as parameters in
this example and allows efficient code and a compile time check.

*The total amount of data is currently limitated to 8 parameters for TRICE8 or 4 parameters for TRICE16 and TRICE32 and two parameters for TRICE64, but this is easy to extend if needed.*

When the embedded project is compiled, only the ID goes to the binary
but not the format string, what results in a smaller memory footprint.

There are different possibilities for internal fifo buffer storage format:
- bare code format
  
  During runtime normally only the 16-bit ID 12345 (together with the parameters like hour, min, sec) is copied to a buffer. Execution time for a TRICE16_1 (as example) on a 48 MHz ARM can be about 16 systicks resulting in 250 nanoseconds duration, so you can use `trice` also inside interrupts or the RTOS scheduler to analyze task timings. The needed buffer space is one 32 bit word per normal trice (for up to 2 data bytes). A direct out transfer is possible but not recommended for serial output because of possible issues to re-sync in case of data loss. Just in case the internal bare fifo overflows, the data are still in sync.

  If the wrap format is desired as output the buffered 4 byte trice is transmitted as an 8 byte packet allowing start byte, sender and receiver addresses and CRC8 check to be used later in parallel with different software protocols.

  The bare output format contains exactly the bare bytes but is enriched with sync packages to achieve syncing. The sync package interval is adjustable.

- (direct) esc(ape) code format

  During untime the esc code format is generated immediately during the TRICE macro execution. This results in a slightly longer TRICE macro execution but allows the direct background transfer to the output device (UART or RTT memory) because re-sync is easy. One advantage of the esc format compared to bare is the more efficient coding of dynamic strings if you have lots of them.

Slightly delayed in the background the TRICE trace goes to the communication port, what is also fast compared to all the actions behind a `printf()` statement.


Please understand, that when debugging code containing TRICE* statements, during a 
TRICE* step-over only  one ore more 32 bit values go into the internal fifo buffer and no serial output
is visible because of the stopped target. But the SEGGER debug probe reads out the RTT memory and this way also during debug stepping realtime trice output is visible. That is (right now) not true for the STLINK interface because the is only one USB enpoint.

## `trice`

Executing `trice update` at the root of your project source updates the TRICE* statements inside the source code and the ID list (only where changes occured). The `-src` switch can be used multiple times to keep the amount of parsed data small for better speed.

With `trice log -port COM12 -baud 115200` you can visualize the trices on the PC, 
if for example `COM12` is receiving the data from the embedded device.

The following capture output comes from an example project inside`../test`

![](README.media/life.gif)

See [triceCheck.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/blob/master/srcTrice.C/triceCheck.c) for reference.
The trices can come mixed from inside interrupts (light blue `ISR:...`) or from normal code. For usage with a RTOS protect TRICE* against breaks. Regard the differences in the read SysTick values inside the GIF above These differeces are the MCU clocks needed for one trice (~0,25Âµs@48MHz).

Use the `-color off` switch for piping output in a file.

<!---
### Check the `trice` binary
- Copy command trice into a path directory.
- Run inside a shell `trice check -list path/to/trice/examples/triceDemoF030R8/MDK-ARM/`[til.json](../examples/triceDemoF030R8/MDK-ARM/til.json). You should see output like this:
![](./README.media/Check.PNG)
--->
### Instrument a target source code project (How to use trice in your project)
Look at one of the appropriate test projects as example. In general:

- Copy [_triceConfig.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/srcTrice.C/_triceConfig.h), rename to `triceConfig.h` and adapt to your needs.

- Make sure the [trice.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/blob/master/srcTrice.C/trice.h) header file is found by your compiler and for

  - bare or wrap transfer format
    
    Include [triceBareFifo.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/blob/master/srcTrice.C/triceBareFifo.c) together with [triceBareFifoToBytesBuffer.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/blob/master/srcTrice.C/triceBareFifoToBytesBuffer.c) into your project.

  - esc transfer format
    
    Include [triceEscFifo.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/blob/master/srcTrice.C/triceEscFifo.c) into your project.

Next steps:

- Add `#include "trice.h"` to your project files where to use TRICE macros and put `TRICE0( Id(0), "msg:Hello world!\n" );` after your initialization code.
- Run `trice u` at the root of your source code. Afterwards:
    - The `Id(0)` should have changed into `Id(12345)` as example. (The `12345` stays here for a 16-bit non-zero random number).
    - A file [til.json](https://github.com/rokath/trice/blob/master/til.json)  (**t**race **i**d **l**ist) should be generated.
- Set up timer and UART interrupt and main loop in the right way. Analyze the test example projects for advice.

<!---    - Running `trice check` should show your message, indicating everything is fine so far.--->

- For help have a look at the differences between these 2 projects or into [DemoF030R8.md](./DemoF030R8.md)
  - `../examples/generatedDemoF030R8` - It is just the STM32 CubeMX generated code.
  - `../examples/traceLDemoF030R8` - It is a copy of the above enhanced with trice check code.
```
Quick and dirty option
======================
- Leave these definitions empty: 
  - TRICE_ENTER_CRITICAL_SECTION & TRICE_LEAVE_CRITICAL_SECTION
  - triceTxDataRegisterEmpty()
  - triceEableTxEmptyInterrupt() & triceDisableTxEmptyInterrupt()
- Use:
  - void triceTransmitData8( uint8_t d ){
    my_putchar( (char)d); // your code
  }
  Call TxStart();TxContinue(); cyclicylly in sufficient long intervals like 1 ms
```

- After compiling and flashing run `trice -port COMn -baud m` with n and m set to correct values
- Now start your device and you should see the hello world message coming from your target. In fact the hello-world string never went to the embedded device, only the ID comes from  there and the string is found in the [til.json](../test/til.json) file of your project.
- If you use a legacy project containing `printf()` statements you can simply transform them to **TRICE\*** statements. TRICE32 will do in most cases but for better performance take **TRCE8** or **TRICE16** where possible.
- `printf(...)` statements containing string format specifier are quickly portable by using `TRICE_P(...)` but without the trice space and speed advantage. The TRICE_P() is intended only for the few dynamic strings in a ported  projekt.  Enable `TRICE_PRINTF_ADAPTER` increases the needed code size by a few KB.
- It could be helpful to add `trice u ...` as prebuild step into your toolchain for each file or for the project as a whole. 
  This way you cannot forget the update step, it performs automatically.

- The core instrumentation needs less 150 bytes FLASH and about 100 bytes RAM when buffer size is 64 bytes.
- The about 50 trices in TriceCheckSet() allocate roughly 2100 (fast mode) or 1500 (small mode) bytes.
- trices are removable without code changes by defining `TRICE_OFF` on file or project level. 

## ID management internals & hints
- During `trice update` so far unknown IDs are added to the ID list (case new sources added) with a `Created` utc timestamp.
- If an ID was deleted inside the source tree (or file removal) the appropriate ID's stays inside the ID list but gets a `Removed` utc timestamp.
- If the same ID appears again the appropriate `Removed` timestamp is deleted inside the ID list and the ID is aktive again.
- If duplicate ID's with different format strings found inside the source tree (case several developers) the newer ID is replaced by a new ID. The probability for such case is low, because of the random ID generation.
- If the format string was modified, the ID goes into the `Removed` state and a new ID is generated.
- Keeping obsolete IDs makes it more comfortable during development to deal with different firmware variants at the same time.
- This way you can simply copy a TRICE* statement and modify it without dealing with the ID. The trice tool will do for you.
- The ID list should go into the version control repository of your project.
- For a firmware release it makes sense to remove all unused IDs (development garbage) from til.json.
  - This could be done by deleting til.json, getting the legacy til.json from the former firmware release from the source control system and enhance it with the actual release software IDs by simply calling 'trice update'.
- During `trice update` TRICE macros commented out are treated in the same way as actice TRICE macros. Even after deletion their content stays inside til.json. This is intensionally to get best stability.

## Encryption
- You can deliver your device with encrypted trices. This way nobody is able to read the trices despite the service guy.
- Implementd is XTEA but this is easy exchangeable.
- The 8 byte blocks can get enrypted by enabling `#define ENRYPT...` inside *triceConfig.h*. You need to add `-key test` as **log** switch and you're done.
- Any password is usable instead of `test`. Simply add once the `-show` switch and copy the displayed passphrase into the *config.h* file.



## Otions for `trice` tool
The trice tool can be started in several modes (subcommands), each with several mantadory or optional switches. Switches can have parameters or not.
```
trice subcommand -switch1 -switch2 parameter -switch3 ...
```
Which subcommand switches are usable for each subcommand is shown with `trice help`. This gives also information about their default values.

Output of `trice h`: (Actual version could slightly differ)
```

```


<!---
### Subcommand `check` 
- `trice check` will check the JSON list and emit all TRICE statements inside the list once with a dataset.

#### `check` switch '-dataset'
- This is a `string` switch. It has one parameter. Its default value is `position`. That means each parameter has a different value. This is useful for testing.
- The `negative` value is uses a dataset with negative values for testing.
--->


## Additional hints

### Logfile viewing
`trice` generated logfiles with subcommand switch `-color off` are normal ASCII files. If they are with color codes, these are ANSI excape sequences.
- One easy view option is `less -R trice.log`. The linux command `less` is also available inside the VScode terminal. 
- Under Windows one could also download and use [ansifilter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ansifilter/) for logfile viewing. A monospaced font is recommended. 

### Color issues under Windows
**Currently CMD console colors are not enabled by default in Win10**, so if you see no color but escape sequences on your powershell or cmd window, please refer to
[Windows console with ANSI colors handling](https://superuser.com/questions/413073/windows-console-with-ansi-colors-handling/1050078#1050078) or simply use a Linux like terminal under windows, like git-bash. One option is also to install Microsoft *Windows Terminal (Preview)* from inside the Microsoft store and to start trice inside there. Unfortunally this can not be done automatically right now because of missing commandline switches.
