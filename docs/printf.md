# Printf-like functions

 ...have a lot of things to do: Copy format string from FLASH memory into a RAM buffer and parse it for format specifiers. Also parse the variadic parameter list and convert each parameter according to its format specifier into a character sequences, what includes several divisions - costly function calls. Concatenate the parts to a new string and deliver it to the output, what often means copying again. A full featured printf library consumes plenty space and time and many open source projects try to make it better in this or that way. Never ever call a printf-like function in time critical code, like an interrupt - it would crash your target in most cases.
