# Arduino IDE Setup
- If you already have it installed you need to add ./arduinoIDE/portable/sketchbook/libraries/trice to your libraries
- You could also download the latest .zip file (portable) from arduino.cc and extract it this way that arduino.exe is parallel to arduinoIDE/portable folder.
- than you can start it and open "Arduino\ATmega328 C-Control Open IoT WIFI Board NanoESP (aka Pretzelboard)\Pretzelboard\Pretzelboard.ino" and is should build without errors
