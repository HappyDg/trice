# ST-Link option

- The provided `stRttLogger.exe` is with the `libusb-1.0.dll` an alternative for using SEGGER RTT with a ST-LINK debug probe instead of a J-LINK device.
  - This is a complete open source solution.
  - It can be interesting for STM NUCLEO boards with a v3 on-board ST-Link wich is not replaceble with an on-board J-LINK software like the v2 ones.
- The command line interface is the same as for `JLinkRTTLogger.exe`.
