\details The format strings are ignored - they go not into the target binary. See trice tool doc for details.
The trices (macros) are dumped as 32bit values into a 32 bit fifo. That is the time critical part.
\li A basic trice (subtrace) consists always of 4 byte: a 16 bit ID with a 16 bit data value.
\li Trices with more data are split into several 32bit basic trice values with IDs = 0 in front.
\li TRICE0, TRICE8_1, TRICE8_2 and TRICE16_1 have 4 bytes size, all others have 8 - 32 bytes size.
\li For trice transmission each basic trice gets a header of additional 4 bytes.
\li The header contains a startbyte, client and server address and a crc8 exOr checksum.
